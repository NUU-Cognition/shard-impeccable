# Impeccable — Repair

Read this when a named defect drives the task.

Source: the Impeccable skill by Paul Bakaus, Apache 2.0, https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable. Ported verbatim except for placeholder resolution, link resolution, and heading depth. See [[dev-knw-imp-upstream]].

## Playbook: clarify

*Upstream: `skill/reference/clarify.md`*

> **Additional context needed**: audience knowledge and emotional state.

Rewrite unclear interface text so users understand what happened, what matters, and what to do next. Preserve factual meaning, product terminology, and brand voice.

### Audit the language

Read the entire interaction path, not isolated strings. Identify:

- ambiguous nouns, verbs, and actions;
- internal jargon or assumed knowledge;
- vague labels, outcomes, and system states;
- missing consequences, recovery, or timing;
- inconsistent terminology and capitalization;
- redundant headings, intros, helper text, and confirmations;
- text that breaks at realistic widths or in translation;
- tone that ignores stress, risk, success, or urgency.

Infer audience and task from product context and surrounding UI. Ask before changing factual claims, legal meaning, or a term that may be domain-specific.

### Set the message hierarchy

For each state, decide:

1. the one fact the user needs now;
2. the action available next;
3. supporting context that changes the decision;
4. the appropriate tone for this moment.

Say each idea once. If the heading already explains the state, the introduction should add new information or disappear.

### Rewrite by function

#### Actions and navigation

Use a specific verb and object when the outcome is not already obvious. Labels should describe what will happen, not the gesture used to trigger it. Keep the same noun and verb for the same concept throughout the product.

For destructive actions, name the object and consequence. Prefer undo over confirmation when recovery is safe. When confirmation is necessary, name the action on both the message and button instead of using `Yes`, `No`, `OK`, or `Submit`.

#### Forms

Use persistent labels; placeholders are examples, not labels. Put format and eligibility requirements before submission. Explain why information is requested only when it is not obvious. Required and optional treatment should be consistent.

Validation says what needs attention and how to correct it without blaming the user. Keep related instructions near the field and announce errors accessibly.

#### Errors and permissions

An actionable error answers:

1. what failed;
2. why, when known and useful;
3. how to recover or what alternative remains.

Do not expose internal codes as the primary message. Do not promise a cause or resolution the system cannot know. Treat privacy, payment, deletion, access loss, and blocked work seriously; warmth is welcome, jokes are not.

#### Loading, empty, and success states

Loading text names the real operation and sets an honest expectation when the wait is meaningful. Show determinate progress when available; never invent progress.

An empty state distinguishes first use, no results, filters, permissions, and failure. Explain the state and provide the next useful action.

Success confirms the completed outcome and mentions the next consequence only when it changes what the user should do. Routine success should be brief.

#### Help and instructional text

Helper text answers an implicit question instead of restating the control. Use progressive disclosure for uncommon detail. Link text must make sense out of context; icon-only controls need accessible names.

### Voice, accessibility, and localization

Voice stays consistent; tone adapts to the moment. Use plain language without flattening terminology the audience genuinely knows.

- Write complete translatable messages rather than concatenated fragments.
- Keep variables and numbers structured so translators can reorder them.
- Allow expansion instead of abbreviating prematurely.
- Make alt text convey the image's information; use empty alt for decoration.
- Keep screen-reader names aligned with visible labels and outcomes.
- Do not rely on punctuation, color, or iconography to carry the message alone.

Maintain a short terminology glossary when inconsistency spans the product. Do not vary words for literary effect in an interface.

### Verify

Read the flow in context and test:

- comprehension without hidden product knowledge;
- actionability at errors, empty states, and decision points;
- factual accuracy and consistent terminology;
- scanability at target widths and 200% zoom;
- long names, localization expansion, pluralization, and dynamic values;
- accessible names and announced state changes;
- tone appropriate to consequence and emotional context.

The final copy is as short as it can be without removing meaning or recovery.

When the language reads cleanly, hand off to `impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## Playbook: adapt

*Upstream: `skill/reference/adapt.md`*

> **Additional context needed**: target platforms/devices and usage contexts.

Adapt an existing design to a different context: another screen size, device, platform, or use case. The trap is treating adaptation as scaling. The job is rethinking the experience for the new context.

**Web only** (mobile web included). Native platforms (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`) route to [[dev-knw-imp-native#Playbook: adapt.native]] instead; if the project is native, switch to it now.

---

### Assess Adaptation Challenge

Understand what needs adaptation and why:

1. **Identify the source context**:
   - What was it designed for originally? (Desktop web? Mobile app?)
   - What assumptions were made? (Large screen? Mouse input? Fast connection?)
   - What works well in current context?

2. **Understand target context**:
   - **Device**: Mobile, tablet, desktop, TV, watch, print?
   - **Input method**: Touch, mouse, keyboard, voice, gamepad?
   - **Screen constraints**: Size, resolution, orientation?
   - **Connection**: Fast wifi, slow 3G, offline?
   - **Usage context**: On-the-go vs desk, quick glance vs focused reading?
   - **User expectations**: What do users expect on this platform?

3. **Identify adaptation challenges**:
   - What won't fit? (Content, navigation, features)
   - What won't work? (Hover states on touch, tiny touch targets)
   - What's inappropriate? (Desktop patterns on mobile, mobile patterns on desktop)

**CRITICAL**: Adaptation is rethinking the experience for the new context, not scaling pixels.

### Plan Adaptation Strategy

Create context-appropriate strategy:

#### Mobile Adaptation (Desktop → Mobile)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Single column instead of multi-column
- Vertical stacking instead of side-by-side
- Full-width components instead of fixed widths
- Bottom navigation instead of top/side navigation

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Touch targets 44x44px minimum (not hover-dependent)
- Swipe gestures where appropriate (lists, carousels)
- Bottom sheets instead of dropdowns
- Thumbs-first design (controls within thumb reach)
- Larger tap areas with more spacing

**Content Strategy**:
- Progressive disclosure (don't show everything at once)
- Prioritize primary content (secondary content in tabs/accordions)
- Shorter text (more concise)
- Larger text (16px minimum)

**Navigation Strategy**:
- Hamburger menu or bottom navigation
- Reduce navigation complexity
- Sticky headers for context
- Back button in navigation flow

#### Tablet Adaptation (Hybrid Approach)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Two-column layouts (not single or three-column)
- Side panels for secondary content
- Master-detail views (list + detail)
- Adaptive based on orientation (portrait vs landscape)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Support both touch and pointer
- Touch targets 44x44px but allow denser layouts than phone
- Side navigation drawers
- Multi-column forms where appropriate

#### Desktop Adaptation (Mobile → Desktop)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Multi-column layouts (use horizontal space)
- Side navigation always visible
- Multiple information panels simultaneously
- Fixed widths with max-width constraints (don't stretch to 4K)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Hover states for additional information
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Right-click context menus
- Drag and drop where helpful
- Multi-select with Shift/Cmd

**Content Strategy**:
- Show more information upfront (less progressive disclosure)
- Data tables with many columns
- Richer visualizations
- More detailed descriptions

#### Print Adaptation (Screen → Print)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Page breaks at logical points
- Remove navigation, footer, interactive elements
- Black and white (or limited color)
- Proper margins for binding

**Content Strategy**:
- Expand shortened content (show full URLs, hidden sections)
- Add page numbers, headers, footers
- Include metadata (print date, page title)
- Convert charts to print-friendly versions

#### Email Adaptation (Web → Email)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Narrow width (600px max)
- Single column only
- Inline CSS (no external stylesheets)
- Table-based layouts (for email client compatibility)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Large, obvious CTAs (buttons not text links)
- No hover states (not reliable)
- Deep links to web app for complex interactions

### Implement Adaptations

Apply changes systematically:

#### Responsive Breakpoints

Choose appropriate breakpoints:
- Mobile: 320px-767px
- Tablet: 768px-1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Or content-driven breakpoints (where design breaks)

#### Layout Adaptation Techniques

- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Reflow layouts automatically
- **Container Queries**: Adapt based on container, not viewport
- **`clamp()`**: Fluid sizing between min and max
- **Media queries**: Different styles for different contexts
- **Display properties**: Show/hide elements per context

#### Touch Adaptation

- Increase touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
- Add more spacing between interactive elements
- Remove hover-dependent interactions
- Add touch feedback (ripples, highlights)
- Consider thumb zones (easier to reach bottom than top)

#### Content Adaptation

- Use `display: none` sparingly (still downloads)
- Progressive enhancement (core content first, enhancements on larger screens)
- Lazy loading for off-screen content
- Responsive images (`srcset`, `picture` element)

#### Navigation Adaptation

- Transform complex nav to hamburger/drawer on mobile
- Bottom nav bar for mobile apps
- Persistent side navigation on desktop
- Breadcrumbs on smaller screens for context

**IMPORTANT**: Test on real devices. Device emulation in DevTools is helpful but not perfect.

**NEVER**:
- Hide core functionality on mobile (if it matters, make it work)
- Assume desktop = powerful device (consider accessibility, older machines)
- Use different information architecture across contexts (confusing)
- Break user expectations for platform (mobile users expect mobile patterns)
- Forget landscape orientation on mobile/tablet
- Use generic breakpoints blindly (use content-driven breakpoints)
- Ignore touch on desktop (many desktop devices have touch)

### Verify Adaptations

Test thoroughly across contexts:

- **Real devices**: Test on actual phones, tablets, desktops
- **Different orientations**: Portrait and landscape
- **Different browsers**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Different OS**: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
- **Different input methods**: Touch, mouse, keyboard
- **Edge cases**: Very small screens (320px), very large screens (4K)
- **Slow connections**: Test on throttled network

**Custom controls** (sliders, drag surfaces, scrollable control strips): a before/after slider can pass every width check above and still refuse to drag on iOS, so exercise each one in scope in the same batched round as the checks above:

- **Primary gesture**: Tap it and confirm it responds as designed, then drag it with the target input method; the drag must complete, not just start
- **Scroll across it**: A swipe along the page's scroll axis across the control scrolls the page or container without activating it; a drag that starts on the control along its axis moves the control, not the page. Neither failure throws an error, so try both
- **Evidence**: Say what produced the evidence: an emulated viewport, synthesized touch input through a browser tool, which engine ran it (Chromium is not Safari), or a physical device. Screenshots and resized viewports verify layout, never a gesture. Name what stayed untested and move on; unreachable hardware is a reported gap, not a blocker

When the adaptation feels native to each context, hand off to `impeccable polish` for the final pass.

### Reference Material

The sections below were previously `responsive-design.md` and live inline now so the adapt flow has its deep responsive reference in one place.

#### Responsive Design

##### Mobile-First: Write It Right

Start with base styles for mobile, use `min-width` queries to layer complexity. Desktop-first (`max-width`) means mobile loads unnecessary styles first.

##### Breakpoints: Content-Driven

Don't chase device sizes; let content tell you where to break. Start narrow, stretch until design breaks, add breakpoint there. Three breakpoints usually suffice (640, 768, 1024px). Use `clamp()` for fluid values without breakpoints.

##### Detect Input Method, Not Just Screen Size

**Screen size doesn't tell you input method.** A laptop with touchscreen, a tablet with keyboard. Use pointer and hover queries:

```css
/* Fine pointer (mouse, trackpad) */
@media (pointer: fine) {
  .button { padding: 8px 16px; }
}

/* Coarse pointer (touch, stylus) */
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .button { padding: 12px 20px; }  /* Larger touch target */
}

/* Device supports hover */
@media (hover: hover) {
  .card:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); }
}

/* Device doesn't support hover (touch) */
@media (hover: none) {
  .card { /* No hover state - use active instead */ }
}
```

**Critical**: Don't rely on hover for functionality. Touch users can't hover.

##### Safe Areas: Handle the Notch

Modern phones have notches, rounded corners, and home indicators. Use `env()`:

```css
body {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);
  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);
}

/* With fallback */
.footer {
  padding-bottom: max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
}
```

**Enable viewport-fit** in your meta tag:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

##### Responsive Images: Get It Right

###### srcset with Width Descriptors

```html
<img
  src="hero-800.jpg"
  srcset="
    hero-400.jpg 400w,
    hero-800.jpg 800w,
    hero-1200.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  alt="Hero image"
>
```

**How it works**:
- `srcset` lists available images with their actual widths (`w` descriptors)
- `sizes` tells the browser how wide the image will display
- Browser picks the best file based on viewport width AND device pixel ratio

###### Picture Element for Art Direction

When you need different crops/compositions (not just resolutions):

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="wide.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="tall.jpg">
  <img src="fallback.jpg" alt="...">
</picture>
```

##### Layout Adaptation Patterns

**Navigation**: Three stages: hamburger + drawer on mobile, horizontal compact on tablet, full with labels on desktop. **Tables**: Transform to cards on mobile using `display: block` and `data-label` attributes. **Progressive disclosure**: Use `<details>/<summary>` for content that can collapse on mobile.

##### Testing: Don't Trust DevTools Alone

DevTools device emulation is useful for layout but misses:

- Actual touch interactions
- Real CPU/memory constraints
- Network latency patterns
- Font rendering differences
- Browser chrome/keyboard appearances

**Test on at least**: One real iPhone, one real Android, a tablet if relevant. Cheap Android phones reveal performance issues you'll never see on simulators.

---

**Avoid**: Desktop-first design. Device detection instead of feature detection. Separate mobile/desktop codebases. Ignoring tablet and landscape. Assuming all mobile devices are powerful.

## Playbook: optimize

*Upstream: `skill/reference/optimize.md`*

Performance is a feature. Identify the actual bottleneck for THIS interface, fix it, then measure. Don't optimize what isn't slow.

### Assess Performance Issues

Understand current performance and identify problems:

1. **Measure current state**:
   - **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, INP, CLS scores
   - **Load time**: Time to interactive, first contentful paint
   - **Bundle size**: JavaScript, CSS, image sizes
   - **Runtime performance**: Frame rate, memory usage, CPU usage
   - **Network**: Request count, payload sizes, waterfall

2. **Identify bottlenecks**:
   - What's slow? (Initial load? Interactions? Animations?)
   - What's causing it? (Large images? Expensive JavaScript? Layout thrashing?)
   - How bad is it? (Perceivable? Annoying? Blocking?)
   - Who's affected? (All users? Mobile only? Slow connections?)

**CRITICAL**: Measure before and after. Premature optimization wastes time. Optimize what actually matters.

### Optimization Strategy

Create systematic improvement plan:

#### Loading Performance

**Optimize Images**:
- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Proper sizing (don't load 3000px image for 300px display)
- Lazy loading for below-fold images
- Responsive images (`srcset`, `picture` element)
- Compress images (80-85% quality is usually imperceptible)
- Use CDN for faster delivery

```html
<img 
  src="hero.webp"
  srcset="hero-400.webp 400w, hero-800.webp 800w, hero-1200.webp 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, 1200px"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Hero image"
/>
```

**Reduce JavaScript Bundle**:
- Code splitting (route-based, component-based)
- Tree shaking (remove unused code)
- Remove unused dependencies
- Lazy load non-critical code
- Use dynamic imports for large components

```javascript
// Lazy load heavy component
const HeavyChart = lazy(() => import('./HeavyChart'));
```

**Optimize CSS**:
- Remove unused CSS
- Critical CSS inline, rest async
- Minimize CSS files
- Use CSS containment for independent regions

**Optimize Fonts**:
- Use `font-display: swap` or `optional`
- Subset fonts (only characters you need)
- Preload critical fonts
- Use system fonts when appropriate
- Limit font weights loaded

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont';
  src: url('/fonts/custom.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-display: swap; /* Show fallback immediately */
  unicode-range: U+0020-007F; /* Basic Latin only */
}
```

**Optimize Loading Strategy**:
- Critical resources first (async/defer non-critical)
- Preload critical assets
- Prefetch likely next pages
- Service worker for offline/caching
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for multiplexing

#### Rendering Performance

**Avoid Layout Thrashing**:
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Alternating reads and writes (causes reflows)
elements.forEach(el => {
  const height = el.offsetHeight; // Read (forces layout)
  el.style.height = height * 2; // Write
});

// ✅ Good: Batch reads, then batch writes
const heights = elements.map(el => el.offsetHeight); // All reads
elements.forEach((el, i) => {
  el.style.height = heights[i] * 2; // All writes
});
```

**Optimize Rendering**:
- Use CSS `contain` property for independent regions
- Minimize DOM depth (flatter is faster)
- Reduce DOM size (fewer elements)
- Use `content-visibility: auto` for long lists
- Virtual scrolling for very long lists (react-window, TanStack Virtual)

**Reduce Paint & Composite**:
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for reliable movement, but allow blur, filters, masks, clip paths, shadows, and color shifts when they create meaningful polish
- Avoid casual animation of layout-driving properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, margins)
- Use `will-change` sparingly for known expensive operations
- Bound expensive paint areas for blur/filter/shadow effects (smaller and isolated is faster)

#### Animation Performance

**GPU Acceleration**:
```css
/* ✅ GPU-accelerated (fast) */
.animated {
  transform: translateX(100px);
  opacity: 0.5;
}

/* ❌ CPU-bound (slow) */
.animated {
  left: 100px;
  width: 300px;
}
```

**Smooth 60fps**:
- Target 16ms per frame (60fps)
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for JS animations
- Debounce/throttle scroll handlers
- Use CSS animations when possible
- Avoid long-running JavaScript during animations

**Intersection Observer**:
```javascript
// Efficiently detect when elements enter viewport
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      // Element is visible, lazy load or animate
    }
  });
});
```

#### React/Framework Optimization

**React-specific**:
- Use `memo()` for expensive components
- `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` for expensive computations
- Virtualize long lists
- Code split routes
- Avoid inline function creation in render
- Use React DevTools Profiler

**Framework-agnostic**:
- Minimize re-renders
- Debounce expensive operations
- Memoize computed values
- Lazy load routes and components

#### Network Optimization

**Reduce Requests**:
- Combine small files
- Use SVG sprites for icons
- Inline small critical assets
- Remove unused third-party scripts

**Optimize APIs**:
- Use pagination (don't load everything)
- GraphQL to request only needed fields
- Response compression (gzip, brotli)
- HTTP caching headers
- CDN for static assets

**Optimize for Slow Connections**:
- Adaptive loading based on connection (navigator.connection)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Request prioritization
- Progressive enhancement

### Core Web Vitals Optimization

#### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP < 2.5s)
- Optimize hero images
- Inline critical CSS
- Preload key resources
- Use CDN
- Server-side rendering

#### Interaction to Next Paint (INP < 200ms)
- Break up long tasks
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use web workers for heavy computation
- Reduce JavaScript execution time

#### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS < 0.1)
- Set dimensions on images and videos
- Don't inject content above existing content
- Use `aspect-ratio` CSS property
- Reserve space for ads/embeds
- Avoid animations that cause layout shifts

```css
/* Reserve space for image */
.image-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Tools to use**:
- Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse, Performance panel)
- WebPageTest
- Core Web Vitals (Chrome UX Report)
- Bundle analyzers (webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- Performance monitoring (Sentry, DataDog, New Relic)

**Key metrics**:
- LCP, INP, CLS (Core Web Vitals; INP replaced FID in March 2024)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Bundle size
- Request count

**IMPORTANT**: Measure on real devices with real network conditions. Desktop Chrome with fast connection isn't representative.

**NEVER**:
- Optimize without measuring (premature optimization)
- Sacrifice accessibility for performance
- Break functionality while optimizing
- Use `will-change` everywhere (creates new layers, uses memory)
- Lazy load above-fold content
- Optimize micro-optimizations while ignoring major issues (optimize the biggest bottleneck first)
- Forget about mobile performance (often slower devices, slower connections)

### Verify Improvements

Test that optimizations worked:

- **Before/after metrics**: Compare Lighthouse scores
- **Real user monitoring**: Track improvements for real users
- **Different devices**: Test on low-end Android, not just flagship iPhone
- **Slow connections**: Throttle to 3G, test experience
- **No regressions**: Ensure functionality still works
- **User perception**: Does it *feel* faster?

When the user-facing numbers move, hand off to `impeccable polish` for the final pass.
